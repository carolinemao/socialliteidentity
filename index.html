    <p> Verifying somebody on Ferns takes two simple steps. First, please enter
        your email in the box below. </p>
        <form>
        <input type= "text" placeholder="Enter your email here." required>
        <button type="submit">Go!</button>
     </form>
    <p> Now, send this link to the person whose photo you want to verify. </p>
    
    
    <p> The person who you have sent this link will now send you a picture of
        themselves holding up numbers with their fingers via email. Note
        that the email you receive will be through our own servers, and
        the person you are communicating with does not have access to your
        personal email. If the person is holding up the correct numbers,
        then feel safe to chat! </p>
